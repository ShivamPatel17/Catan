# moving to vite

- ok so ill use vite so i can get some better lsp support

## step i've taken

- adding a package.json with `npm init -y`
- adding a `.vite.config.js`
- rewriting my .js files to use the new phaser module

## to do later

- test that the new set up works offline
- remove the vendored phaser.js
- figure out how to deploy this in prod with `npx vite build`
